
For this project we will get data from the following datasets :
Mumbai Restaurants data that contains localities, restaurant names, restaurant rating along with their latitudes and longitudes:
Data source : Zomato kaggel dataset : "https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data"
Data description : This dataset caters the needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the country and which locality of that country serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants. This dataset contains the information we need for analysis and we will use it to explore various locality of Mumbai.

Venues near each neighbourhood of Mumbai:
Data source : Fousquare API : "https://developer.foursquare.com/"

Strategy for problem solving:
* Collect the Mumbai city data from Zomato kaggel dataset
* We will find all venues for each neighborhood using FourSquare API 
* Group the venues by nearby locality
* Find the best places on the basis of aggregate rating.
* Using folium library, visualise the results.
