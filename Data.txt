
For this project we will get data from the following datasets :
Mumbai Restaurants data that contains localities, restaurant names, restaurant rating along with their latitudes and longitudes:
Data source : Zomato kaggel dataset ("https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data")
Data description : This dataset caters to the needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the country and to  determine which locality of that country serves that cuisine with maximum number of restaurants. This dataset contains the information we need for analysis and we will use it to explore various localities of Mumbai.

Venues near each neighbourhood of Mumbai:
Data source : Fousquare API ( "https://developer.foursquare.com/")
Description : This Dataset will provide us with the location based data we need to explore neighbourhood in Mumbai.By using this api, we will get all the venues in each neighborhood in Mumbai.

Strategy for problem solving:
* Collect the Mumbai city data from Zomato kaggel dataset
* We will find all venues for each neighborhood using FourSquare API 
* Group the venues by nearby locality
* Find the best places on the basis of aggregate rating.
* Using folium library, visualise the results.
